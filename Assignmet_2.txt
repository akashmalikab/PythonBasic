1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
ANS. TRUE and FALSE.

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
ANS. AND, OR, NOT

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
ANS. True and True = True
     True and False = False
     False and True = False
     False and False = False

    True or True = True
    True or False = True
    False or True = True
    False or False = False

    not(True) = False
    not(False) = True

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

ANS. FALSE
     FALSE
     TRUE
     FALSE
     TRUE
     TRUE


5. What are the six comparison operators?
ANS. >, <, ==,  >=, <=, !=

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
ANS. The “=” is an assignment operator used to assign a value to a operator
    The '==' operator checks two operands are equal or not.
    EX : a=5, b=6   if a==b : pass

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon'&#39;')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

ANS. 1st block : if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')

    2nd block : if spam > 5:
                print('bacon'&#39;')
                else:
                print('ham')

    3rd block : print('spam')
                print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
ANS.
    spam = input("Please enter value of spam ")
    if spam == 1:
        print('Hello')
    elif spam == 2:
        print('Howdy')
    else:
        print('Greetings!')


9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
Ans.Ctrl + C

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans. Break will come out the loop i.e In break statement control exists from loop and
     Continue will skip only 1 particular iteration of the loop and moves to next.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans. All three are same

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
ANS. for i in range(1,101) :
      print(i)

        i = 1
        while(i<=10):
            print(i)
        i = i + 1


13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
ANS. spam.bacon()
