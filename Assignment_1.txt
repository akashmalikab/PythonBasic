# 2. What is the difference between string and variable?
ANS: A variable is something in which we can store values like a = 10, b = 'akash'. Here a & b are variables which have values 10 and 'akash' respectively.
     Taking about string it is a datatype of variable for ex b is a variable whose datatype is string.

# 3. Describe three different data types.
ANS. String : A string datatype can have characters, special characters, numbers or a combination of all in it. For creating string vaiable we use ''. For ex: 'akash', 'ak@gail', '12ab', '154'
     INT : An int datatype can only have numbers. For ex : 12, 4567456, 1
     Float : A float datatype can have decimals values. For ex : 12.24, 34.90
Note : To find datatype of any variable in python we use 'type()' function
